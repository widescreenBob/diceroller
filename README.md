Die Roller Read Me.

This is a basic random number generator that allows a person to select the die type, and it will generate a number between 1 and the value of the dice, ie a d8 will be between 1 and 8.

I created this initally in codepen, and then extracted the code to be able to get web access from a url.
I ran the js through babel site to avoid having to add build tools.
